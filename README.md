# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use machine learning to predict house prices based on various features. It includes a Python script that trains a model and provides predictions. This README will guide you through the setup and usage of the project.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.6+)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided Jupyter notebook)
- Required Python libraries, which can be installed via pip:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn 
Dataset:
   The dataset used in this project is not provided in this repository. You will need to obtain the dataset separately and place it in the data/ directory. The dataset should be in CSV format with features and the target variable (house prices).
Usage:
  Clone this repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/au950821106060/house-price-prediction.git) 
Navigate:
  To the project directory:cd house-price-prediction
1.Place your dataset in the data/ directory.
2.Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model. There are two options:
 *Jupyter Notebook: Open and run the House_Price_Prediction.ipynb notebook using Jupyter. This provides a step-by-step explanation of the code and visualizations.
 *Python script: Run the house_price_prediction.py script in your terminal or IDE.
3.After running the script or notebook, you can make predictions on new data by calling the prediction function. You may need to modify the script for this purpose.
# Example code for making predictions
from house_price_prediction import predict_house_price

# Modify the input data as needed
input_data = {
    "feature1": value1,
    "feature2": value2,
    # ...
}

predicted_price = predict_house_price(input_data)
print(f"Predicted House Price: ${predicted_price:.2f}")
